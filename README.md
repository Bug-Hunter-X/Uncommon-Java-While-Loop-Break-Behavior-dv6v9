This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Java involving the use of `break` statements within a `while` loop.  The primary issue is the potential for unexpected behavior if the code intends to execute additional statements following the loop but only breaks conditionally.  The `BuggyWhileLoop.java` file shows the erroneous behavior, whereas `FixedWhileLoop.java` provides a corrected solution, illustrating how to handle such situations effectively.  This example is useful for programmers to understand subtle control flow intricacies in Java.
